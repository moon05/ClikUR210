# ClikUR210
##**ClikUR**  
**_Project Milestone 1_**  
CSC 210: Web Programming  
Group: Abdullah Al Mamun, Yukako Ito  
Due 10/20 11:59pm  
  
##**Target Audience + Problem**  
ClikUR targets college students and professors, hoping to solve the monetary obstacle of purchasing a Clicker device, to ease the communication between students and professor, and also making it easy for the data to be accessed by both parties.  
  
##**Meeting the Requirements**  
First of all we are hosting everything on GitHub.
We have two parts of this project, one is a website and the other is a phone app.
There will be signup and signin features on the website and the app, which makes it CRUD. Considering the feasibility of the project, we will be creating another very simple website that will be a mockup of the app.
We have taken permission from Prof. Philip Guo to make this part of the project of CSC 212. And there we are actually making the phone app. So, if the phone app is made in time (by the 4th Milestone deadline) and we can properly integrate it with the website's database, we will showcase the both the website and the real app.
  
##**Why ClikUR?**  
With ClikUR, there will no longer be a need to purchase a  $45 to $55 device! Instead, this application will offer a cheaper alternative, utilizing a device students already own, a smartphone. ClikUR will include two features: anonymous question-asking and feedback. This allows students to ask questions and critique the course and professor anonymously to allow more communication outlets between the student body and the instructor. Students will also be able to easily participate in quizzes, mark attendance etc., while the professor will be able to view and collect the data given by the students.
