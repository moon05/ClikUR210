# ClikUR210
##**ClikUR**  
Project Milestone 1
CSC 210: Web Programming
Group: Abdullah Al Mamun, Yukako Ito
Due 10/20 11:59pm  
  
##**Target Audience + Problem**  
ClikUR targets college students and professors, hoping to solve the monetary obstacle of purchasing a Clicker device, to ease the communication between students and professor, and also making it easy for the data to be accessed by both parties.  
  
##**Meeting Requirements**  
How will it meet the minimum project requirements?
Create a CRUD Web application that supports Web 2.0-style Ajax interactions, using the concepts from Lectures 1 to 7.
allow users to create accounts and add new persistent data
read data from the server and present it on a webpage
allow users to update their existing data
allow users to delete their own data and accounts
do all of the above without reloading the webpage (Ajax) [Instead of Ajax, you can also use WebSockets]
A static personal website or even a dynamic weather-lookup app would not meet our requirements, since those are read-only.
You are free to use any programming languages, libraries, or frameworks that you like. However, if you would like to get help from your TA, please ask them what tools they are most familiar with, so that you can get the best help from them.
Here are a few high-level rules:
Your Web app must work properly when viewed in a modern Web browser without installing any plug-ins or extensions. This means no Flash, no Silverlight, no Java, etc. It also means that your client-side code must be some form of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
All of your project's code must be publicly hosted on GitHub.
Your team must be able to demo the project in-person to your TA for grading and allow your TA to use your Web app, either on your own computer or online.
  
##**Why ClikUR?**  
With ClikUR, there will no longer be a need to purchase a  $45 to $55 device! Instead, this application will offer a cheaper alternative, utilizing a device students already own, a smartphone. ClikUR will include two features: anonymous question-asking and feedback. This allows students to ask questions and critique the course and professor anonymously to allow more communication outlets between the student body and the instructor. Students will also be able to easily participate in quizzes, mark attendance etc., while the professor will be able to view and collect the data given by the students.
